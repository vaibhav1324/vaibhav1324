I'm a 24-year-old front-end software engineer based in the beautiful Goa, India. With a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Goa Engineering College under my belt, I've spent the last three years coding my way through various projects for a company based in Minnesota, USA.

As an explorer in the vast universe of tech, I love diving into new technologies and always aim to follow best coding practices. But wait, there's more! Beyond the world of curly braces and semicolons, I'm a classical musician who can play the Tabla, with a degree in Music to vouch for my skills. üéµ

When I'm not architecting interfaces or creating harmony through my music, you'll find me at the gym lifting weights or expressing my creativity through poetry. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìù

Welcome to my GitHub profile - a digital gallery of my tech explorations. Feel free to explore, leave feedback, or get in touch! üí¨

And oh, did I mention? I'm a space enthusiast, completely fascinated by the vast expanse of the universe. From black holes to quantum physics, I'm your go-to guy for intriguing space facts and discussions. üåå

`In the fascinating world of quantum physics, I'm entangled with my love for coding. Heisenberg may be uncertain, but my passion for science and technology is absolute! ‚óé`

So, here I am, a coder, a musician, a poet, a fitness enthusiast, and a space nerd all rolled into one. Nice to meet you! üòÑ
